# Procedure overview:
#- Have a source collection for commits and target collection for commits.
#- Retreive 500 repos at a time, take the url and full_name properties, store them in a dict.
#- Retrieve 500 comits at a time, extract a full_name from the commit. If it matches one
# of the repos, insert it to the target collection.

#- It is not possible to do an $in query here, because the commits only have a url property
# and no full_name property. However, a url can be extracted from the full_name, so that's
# why we iterate over all of the commits.
